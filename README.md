[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jacobwhall/plaited/badge.svg?branch=trunk)](https://coveralls.io/github/jacobwhall/plaited?branch=trunk)

plaited is a [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) [filter](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) that uses [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) [kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) to generate code notebooks.
It's a flexible tool for publishing documents that include code execution in a variety of languages and formats.
It is a fork of [Knitty](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty), which is a fork of [Stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch), which used code from [knitpy](https://github.com/jankatins/knitpy) and [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert).

## Installation

plaited is available on TestPyPI:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ plaited
```

I will publish it to PyPI once it is more mature.

## Getting Started

plaited is plug-and-play with Pandoc:

```bash
pandoc --filter plaited -o out.html input.md
```

## Motivation

_Why another code notebook generator?_

Ultimately, plaited is a personal project that I work on for my own benefit.
After reading about Codebraid, Stitch, and Knitty, I wanted a similar tool that meets the following criteria:

### Pandoc filter

- embrace Pandoc AST, allowing other filters, templates, or Pandoc itself to make any formatting decisions
- use [Panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute) to manage document elements

### Jupyter client

- embrace [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) as the means of code execution
- use [Jupyter Client](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client) to interface with the kernels

### modern Python package

- aim to write hackable, maintainable code
- use modern setuptools configuration

## License

There seems to have been a misunderstanding by previous developers of this project regarding license compatibility.
[Stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch) and [Knitty](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty), by Tom Augspurger and Peter Zagubisalo respectively, were released using the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
Their code is adapted from the [knitpy](https://github.com/jankatins/knitpy) and [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython) projects, both released under BSD licenses.
I am not a lawyer, but I do not believe that BSD licenses are compatible with the MIT license.
I hope that by relicensing this project under the Modified (3-Clause) BSD License, work by all prior contributors is being used according to their original licenses.
This is not legal advice, and I welcome any feedback regarding the licensure of this repository.
