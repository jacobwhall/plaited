# plaited ðŸª¢

plaited is a [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) [filter](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) that uses [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) [kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) to execute code inline. It's a flexible tool for writing and publishing code notebooks in a variety of languages and formats. It is a fork of [Knitty](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty), which is a fork of [Stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch), which used code from [knitpy](https://github.com/jankatins/knitpy) and nbconvert.

## Installation

## License

There seems to have been a misunderstanding by previous developers of this project regarding license compatibility.
[Stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch) and [Knitty](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty), by Tom Augspurger and Peter Zagubisalo respectively, were released using the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
Their code is adapted from the [knitpy](https://github.com/jankatins/knitpy) and [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython) projects, both released under BSD licenses.
I am not a lawyer, but I do not believe that BSD licenses are compatible with the MIT license.
I hope that by relicensing this project under the Modified (3-Clause) BSD License, work by all prior contributors is being used according to their original licenses.
This is not legal advice, and I welcome any feedback or complaints about the licensure of this repository.
