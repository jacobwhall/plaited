# plaited ðŸª¢

plaited is a [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) [filter](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) that uses [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) [kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) to execute code inline. It's a flexible tool for writing and publishing code notebooks in a variety of languages and formats. It is a fork of [Knitty](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty), which is a fork of [Stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch), which used code from [knitpy](https://github.com/jankatins/knitpy) and nbconvert.

## Installation
